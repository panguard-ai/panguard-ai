# Product Overview

> AI-Driven Adaptive Endpoint Protection

---

## What is Panguard AI?

Panguard AI is an open-source cybersecurity platform designed for developers and small businesses who don't have a security team.

The core idea is simple: **sign up on the website, log in from CLI, and AI protects your machines automatically. It tells you when something happens. When nothing happens, you do nothing.**

### User Experience

Like Claude Code:

1. **Website** - Browse plans, sign up, manage subscriptions
2. **CLI** - `panguard login` opens browser for auth, token stored locally
3. **Usage** - Features gated by subscription tier, zero daily operation

### Why Panguard AI?

Traditional security tools:

- Require expertise to install and configure
- Interfaces full of Sigma, YARA, IOC, MITRE ATT&CK jargon
- Generate thousands of alerts with no prioritization
- Enterprise tools cost six figures; free tools are unusable

Panguard AI:

- **One command install**, zero configuration
- **Plain language notifications** via LINE / Telegram / Slack
- **AI auto-judges** severity and executes responses
- **Gets smarter over time**, learning from your environment

### Three-Layer AI Funnel

| Layer | Technology | Handles | Latency | Cost |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------|------|
| Layer 1 | Sigma/YARA rules engine | 90% | < 50ms | $0 |
| Layer 2 | Local AI (Ollama) | 7% | ~2s | $0 |
| Layer 3 | Cloud AI | 3% | ~5s | $0.008/call |

Cloud down? Local AI takes over. Local AI down? Rules engine keeps running. Protection never stops.
