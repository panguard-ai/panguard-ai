# Product Overview

> AI-Driven Adaptive Endpoint Protection

---

## What is Panguard AI?

Panguard AI is an open-source cybersecurity platform designed for developers and small businesses who don't have a security team.

The core idea is simple: **install, and AI protects your machines automatically. It tells you when something happens. When nothing happens, you do nothing.**

### User Experience

Like Claude Code:

1. **Install** - One command install, zero configuration
2. **CLI** - `panguard guard start` begins protection immediately
3. **Usage** - Zero daily operation required

### Why Panguard AI?

Traditional security tools:

- Require expertise to install and configure
- Interfaces full of security jargon (IOC, MITRE ATT&CK, etc.)
- Generate thousands of alerts with no prioritization
- Enterprise tools cost six figures; free alternatives are hard to use

Panguard AI:

- **One command install**, zero configuration
- **Plain language notifications** via Telegram / Slack
- **AI auto-judges** severity and executes responses
- **Gets smarter over time**, learning from your environment

```

- System discovery (OS, network, ports, services)
- Password policy audit
- Firewall status check
- SSL/TLS certificate validation
- Risk score 0-100 (grades A-F)

### Panguard Chat - AI Security Notifications

Translates technical security alerts into plain language and delivers them through your preferred channel.

```bash
panguard chat setup --channel line --user-type boss
```

- 5 notification channels: Telegram, Slack (Block Kit), Email (SMTP/HTML), Webhook (mTLS), LINE
- 3 tone modes:
  - **boss** - Impact summary, plain language

### Three-Layer AI Funnel

| Layer   | Technology        | Handles | Latency | Cost        |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Layer 1 | ATR rules engine  | 90%     | < 50ms  | $0          |
| Layer 2 | Local AI (Ollama) | 7%      | ~2s     | $0          |
| Layer 3 | Cloud AI          | 3%      | ~5s     | $0.008/call |

Cloud down? Local AI takes over. Local AI down? Rules engine keeps running. Protection never stops.
